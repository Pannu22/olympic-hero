### Project Overview

 In this project I found the best country in olympic.


### Learnings from the project

 In this project I learnt different dataframe operations, bar graph plotting, mathematical operations.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 We cannot say a country to be a best olympic country who won maximum number of Gold medal. So for finding the best country in olympics we have to consider all the medals i.e. Gold, Silver & Bronze. Based on this I did the calculations and find out the best country.
